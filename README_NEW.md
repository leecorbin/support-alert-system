# Install dependencies
npm install
cd functions && npm install && cd ..
cd client && npm install && cd ..

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Configuration

üìñ **[Complete Setup Guide](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)** - Detailed step-by-step instructions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components

- **Firebase Functions**: Webhook processing and escalation detection
- **React Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface
- **Firestore Database**: Conversation and event storage
- **HubSpot Webhooks**: Real-time conversation event streaming

### Data Flow

1. HubSpot sends webhook events for conversation assignments
2. Firebase Functions process events and detect bot-to-human escalations
3. Events stored in Firestore with proper indexing
4. React dashboard polls Firestore every 10 seconds
5. Visual indicators update based on current support status

## üìä Dashboard Features

### Real-Time Metrics

- **Active Conversations**: Live count of ongoing chats
- **Escalated Sessions**: Conversations escalated to humans
- **New Chat Alerts**: Immediate notification of new conversations
- **Response Time Tracking**: Monitor escalation detection speed

### Visual Indicators

- **Green Gradient**: No active escalations
- **Orange/Red Gradient**: Active escalations requiring attention
- **Enhanced Timestamps**: Human-readable time formatting
- **Status Cards**: Clear visual summary of current state

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Firebase Configuration
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project

# HubSpot Integration (Firebase Secrets)
HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=pat-na1-xxxxxxxxxxxx
BOT_AGENT_IDS=L-67300874,other-bot-id
```

### Bot Agent ID Discovery

Your bot agent IDs are unique to your HubSpot account. Find them by:

1. Monitoring webhook events in Firebase logs
2. Looking for agent IDs when conversations start with bots
3. Contacting HubSpot support for your specific bot IDs

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Development

```bash
# Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start

# Start React development server
cd client && npm start
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test webhook processing
curl -X POST https://your-function-url/hubspotWebhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"subscriptionType":"conversation.assignment","objectId":123,"propertyValue":"L-67300874"}]'
```

### Debug Endpoints

- `/getEscalationDebugInfo` - Configuration and recent activity
- `/debugConversationEscalation` - Specific conversation analysis
- `/getWebhookActivity` - Recent webhook events
- `/manualEscalationProcess` - Manual escalation processing

## üìà Performance & Costs

### Optimization

- **10-second polling** for real-time feel with cost efficiency
- **Composite Firestore indexes** for fast queries
- **Efficient webhook processing** with minimal function execution time
- **Strategic data caching** to reduce read operations

### Expected Costs (Monthly)

- **Firebase Functions**: $1-5 (normal usage)
- **Firestore**: $1-3 (10-50 conversations/day)
- **Firebase Hosting**: Free tier sufficient
- **Total**: $2-8/month for small to medium support teams

## üîí Security

### Access Control

- **Firebase Security Rules**: Read-only access from dashboard
- **Function-only Writes**: All data modifications through Functions
- **Secrets Management**: HubSpot tokens stored as Firebase secrets
- **Environment Variables**: No hardcoded sensitive data

### Best Practices

- Regular token rotation
- Monitor for unauthorized access
- Secure webhook endpoints
- Audit logs for debugging

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook Not Working**: Check HubSpot subscription and function URL
2. **Bot IDs Not Detected**: Verify bot agent ID configuration
3. **Dashboard Not Updating**: Check Firestore security rules
4. **High Costs**: Reduce polling frequency or optimize queries

### Monitoring

- Firebase Functions logs for webhook processing
- Firestore usage metrics for cost optimization
- HubSpot webhook delivery status
- Dashboard network requests for client issues
